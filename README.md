## Description
This project is intended to take the mystery out of recycling. Users can get answers to two basic questions: HOW to recycle various items, and WHERE to take their recycling. Through this project, our group learned valuable skills about collaboration in the development process, including meeting in daily scrums, writing well-defined issues, making frequent commits, and how to resolve conflicts within pull requests.  We also had the opportunity to practice the skills we've learned in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and pulling information from third-party APIs.

## Credits
Class member Christopher Lee helped us pin locations onto Google Maps. We also used the code provided in the Google Maps documentation as a starting point. Access the page here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#find_place_from_query.

Our instructor, Ben Wright, showed us how to create a new array from objects within an existing array.

The following sources were used to learn about different coding methods:
- In the script.js file lines 234-243, we used the following article to learn how to create a button with a link within a JavaScript file: 'How to Create a Link in JavaScript' - https://www.3schools.in/2021/11/how-to-create-link-in-javascript.html#:~:text=There%20are%20some%20steps%20to,element%20with%20aTag.
- In the script.js file lines 222 and 223, we used two methods to search an array: .indexOf() and .includes(). The source for this is found in the following article: 'Four Different Ways to Search and Array in JavaScript' - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/4-methods-to-search-an-array/#:~:text=Use%20filter%20if%20you%20want,particular%20item%20in%20an%20array.
