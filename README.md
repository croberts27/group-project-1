## Description
This project is intended to take the mystery out of recycling. Users can get answers to two basic questions: HOW to recycle various items, and WHERE to take their recycling. Through this project, our group learned valuable skills about collaboration in the development process, including meeting in daily scrums, writing well-defined issues, making frequent commits, and how to resolve conflicts within pull requests.  We also had the opportunity to practice the skills we've learned in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and pulling information from third-party APIs.
